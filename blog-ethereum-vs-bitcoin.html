      <section id="origins" style="margin-top:18px">
        <h3>Origins and purpose</h3>
        <p>
          Bitcoin launched in 2009 with a single, audacious goal. Create sound money for the internet that nobody can inflate, freeze, or control.
          Satoshi Nakamoto’s design favored simplicity, verifiability, and long term credibility. The network focuses on doing one thing well:
          secure, uncensorable settlement of value. If you want the backstory and why the anonymous creator changed the world,
          read our feature <a class="orange-link" href="blog-satoshi-nakamoto.html">Satoshi Nakamoto: The Anonymous Creator Who Changed the World</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ethereum launched in 2015 with a broader vision: a general purpose blockchain where developers can deploy smart contracts
          and build decentralized applications. If Bitcoin is a conservative base layer for savings and settlement,
          Ethereum positioned itself as a flexible platform for programmable money and digital agreements.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="policy">
        <h3>Monetary policy and issuance</h3>
        <p>
          Bitcoin’s monetary policy is famously rigid. Supply is capped at <strong>21 million</strong> coins.
          Issuance follows a predictable schedule called the <em>halving</em>, where block rewards are cut every 210,000 blocks
          until new issuance asymptotically approaches zero. If you want to track progress, use our
          <a class="orange-link" href="index.html#halving">Halving Countdown</a>, and dive deeper in
          <a class="orange-link" href="blog-bitcoin-21-million-supply.html">Why Bitcoin Has a 21 Million Supply</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ethereum’s supply policy has evolved over time. After its transition to proof of stake, issuance dropped,
          and network fees that are burned can offset issuance during high activity, leading to periods of net reduction in supply.
          The key difference: Bitcoin optimizes for scarcity credibility via hard cap and predictable issuance,
          while Ethereum optimizes for flexible economics that support a programmable platform.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="consensus">
        <h3>Consensus and security</h3>
        <p>
          Bitcoin secures the ledger with proof of work mining. Specialized hardware expends energy to propose blocks,
          and the chain with the most accumulated work wins. This makes attacks extremely expensive,
          ties security to objective physical cost, and has withstood real world stress for more than a decade.
          For a clear primer, see <a class="orange-link" href="blog-bitcoin-mining-network-security.html">Why Bitcoin Mining Secures the Network</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ethereum began with proof of work but later migrated to proof of stake. Validators stake ETH, propose and attest to blocks,
          and risk losing stake if they misbehave. This design reduces energy requirements and improves certain programmability features,
          while shifting the economic model of security from electricity and hardware to capital at stake.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="programmability">
        <h3>Programmability and smart contracts</h3>
        <p>
          Ethereum’s signature innovation is native smart contracts. Developers write logic that automatically executes on chain.
          This enables tokens, stablecoins, decentralized exchanges, lending markets, NFTs, and more. The platform acts as an open,
          composable financial operating system where apps can interconnect like Lego bricks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bitcoin intentionally keeps the base layer conservative and simpler. Script exists but is limited by design to preserve auditability,
          verifiability, and minimization of attack surface. More complex functionality can be added on layers above the base,
          such as the Lightning Network for payments.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="scaling">
        <h3>Scaling paths and trade offs</h3>
        <p>
          Bitcoin’s mainstream scaling path emphasizes layers. The base layer remains slow and highly secure, while
          payment speed and throughput move to protocols like Lightning. If you want to experiment with everyday amounts,
          try converting with our <a class="orange-link" href="index.html#converter">BTC ⇄ Fiat ⇄ Sats Converter</a> first,
          then explore Lightning-friendly wallets discussed in
          <a class="orange-link" href="blog-bitcoin-wallets-cold-storage.html">Understanding Wallets and Cold Storage</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ethereum scales through a combination of on chain improvements and off chain layers often called rollups.
          In this model, transactions are executed off the main chain but inherit security by posting proofs or data to Ethereum.
          The design increases expressiveness for applications while distributing throughput across many rollups.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="use-cases">
        <h3>Real world use cases</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Bitcoin</strong> is primarily used as a store of value and neutral settlement layer. Individuals use it as
          inflation protection, a cross border savings technology, and a way to exit capital controls.
          For powerful stories from emerging markets, read
          <a class="orange-link" href="blog-bitcoin-developing-economies.html">Bitcoin in Developing Economies</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ethereum</strong> is used to deploy and interact with applications. Decentralized exchanges, stablecoins,
          NFTs, and on chain organizations are all built with smart contracts. Many teams treat Ethereum as programmable infrastructure
          for building new digital markets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both networks are complementary in practice. People may save long term in Bitcoin and still use Ethereum applications,
          just as people save in one currency and spend in another.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="self-custody">
        <h3>Self custody and user responsibility</h3>
        <p>
          On both networks, the golden rule is the same. Your keys, your coins. Without self custody, you hold an IOU at best.
          If you are new to hardware wallets, backup phrases, and safe spending flows, bookmark our deep dive:
          <a class="orange-link" href="blog-bitcoin-wallets-cold-storage.html">Understanding Bitcoin Wallets and Why Cold Storage Matters</a>.
          The concepts apply broadly even if you later interact with smart contracts elsewhere.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="investor">
        <h3>Investor frameworks: conviction and risk</h3>
        <p>
          If you are evaluating these networks as investments, begin with first principles and behavior.
          What are you buying and why? Are you drawn to Bitcoin’s conservative design and hard cap scarcity,
          or to Ethereum’s flexible platform and application ecosystem? Many long term savers prefer intentional simplicity
          and the discipline of holding. If you are curious about that mindset, read
          <a class="orange-link" href="blog-psychology-of-hodling.html">The Psychology of HODLing</a>.

      <section id="conclusion">
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Bitcoin and Ethereum emerged from the same movement yet chose different priorities. Bitcoin sacrifices some flexibility
          to maximize credibility as global digital savings. Ethereum sacrifices some simplicity to enable a rich world of on chain logic.
          Neither design is an accident. Both reflect clear values and trade offs.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you came here to decide “which is better,” the honest answer is that it depends on your goals.
          If you want a neutral base savings asset with a transparent issuance schedule, Bitcoin’s design will likely resonate.
          If you want to experiment with programmable money and decentralized applications, Ethereum offers a powerful toolkit.
          Many participants end up using both for different reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever you choose, act with intention. Model your plan with the
          <a class="orange-link" href="index.html#dca">DCA Calculator</a>, test outcomes with the
