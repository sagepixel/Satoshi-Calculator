        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Bitcoin gives you freedom, but with freedom comes responsibility. There is no bank to reverse a mistake, and there is no customer service line that can pull back a transaction after it is confirmed. That is both the beauty and the risk of a system that removes middlemen. The best defense is knowledge, followed by simple habits that reduce attack surface to nearly zero. In this guide you will learn the most common scams, the red flags that appear again and again, and the steps that protect you no matter how the scam is packaged.
        </p>
        <p>
          For quick reference, bookmark your trusted tools on one page. Use our <a class="orange-link" href="index.html#converter">Converter</a> for price lookups, the <a class="orange-link" href="index.html#profit">Profit Calculator</a> and <a class="orange-link" href="index.html#dca">DCA tool</a> for planning, and the <a class="orange-link" href="index.html#halving">Halving tab</a> for long term context. Tools make you less likely to fall for someone else’s narrative. Numbers and first principles keep you safe.

      <section id="giveaway">
        <h3>Scam 1: Giveaway and multiplier promises</h3>
        <p>
          The classic trap goes like this. A fake account that looks like a famous person or exchange announces a celebration or a bonus pool. Send one amount of Bitcoin and receive two times back. Sometimes it is a new token offer that needs a small deposit to unlock the airdrop. The site looks polished and the comments look positive, but everything is staged. Once you send coins, they are gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Red flags are clear. Requests to send crypto to receive more. Urgency and time pressure. Strange URLs that imitate the real brand. Comment sections full of repeated praise posts. None of these things appear in legitimate offers. Real companies never ask you to send funds first to prove eligibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          What to do instead. Ignore the tease and check facts yourself. Visit the official website by typing the address manually. Find the announcement on the real account timeline. Most of the time you will discover there is no such event. When in doubt, do nothing. Waiting is the safest choice in Bitcoin.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="support">
        <h3>Scam 2: Fake support and account recovery</h3>
        <p>
          You post on social media that your withdrawal is delayed or your account is locked. Minutes later a friendly support handle reaches out through direct messages. They offer quick help and ask you to click a link or share your seed phrase to verify ownership. The page looks official. The chat feels professional. It is all theater.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember a single rule. No real support agent will ever ask for your recovery phrase. That phrase grants full control over your funds. Anyone who requests it is attempting theft. Real support channels are only the ones listed on the official domain of the company, never the ones that cold message you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Safer approach. Bookmark the official help center of any service you use. If you must talk to support, open a ticket from the dashboard after signing in on the real site, not through links in emails or messages. If you self custody, there is no support for your seed phrase because you are the bank. Protect that phrase like your life savings depend on it, because they do.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="investment">
        <h3>Scam 3: High yield investment schemes</h3>
        <p>
          Humans are wired to chase easy gains. Scammers sell the dream using professional looking dashboards that show a line going up and to the right. They talk about secret trading bots, a special arbitrage strategy, or a guaranteed daily return. The hook is always the same. Deposit Bitcoin and watch the balance grow while you sleep. Early withdrawals work to build trust, then the window closes and the site vanishes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Signals to watch. Guaranteed returns. Pressure to invite friends through referral links. Charts that are not connected to any real market. Withdrawal fees that grow each time you try to exit. Contracts that are not registered in any jurisdiction. These are the patterns of a classic ponzi.
        </p>
        <p>
          A better mindset. Adopt slow and steady thinking. Run numbers with the <a class="orange-link" href="index.html#dca">DCA tool</a> to see how regular buying removes emotion from decisions. Use the <a class="orange-link" href="index.html#profit">Profit Calculator</a> to explore scenarios without trusting a stranger with your coins. Patience is a superpower and it is free.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="phishing">
        <h3>Scam 4: Phishing sites and wallet drainers</h3>
        <p>
          Phishing is the art of imitation. Attackers copy the look of a popular exchange or wallet and trick you into entering your credentials or signing a malicious message. In the browser this often starts with a sponsored search result for a mistyped domain. On mobile it can appear through a link in a message that looks like a trusted contact. Sometimes a plug in prompts you to connect a wallet and sign a request that gives spending permission to the attacker.
        </p>
        <p>
          Defense through habits. Type addresses manually and bookmark the correct URLs. Use a password manager so it only fills on the exact domain you expect. Before signing anything, read the message and ask yourself what permission you are granting. If the request feels confusing, cancel and research. Confusion is not a bug, it is the plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Extra technical layers help. Enable multifactor authentication with a time based app rather than text messages. Keep your operating system and browser up to date. Consider a separate browser profile for anything crypto related and remove unused extensions. Each small layer reduces exposure and compounds your safety.
        </p>

      <section id="romance">
        <h3>Scam 5: Romance and social engineering</h3>
        <p>
          Not every scam comes with code. Many start with a conversation. An account builds trust over days or weeks and then introduces an investment opportunity. They offer to guide you through a platform that has been working for them. Screenshots show impressive profits. The site looks credible and your new friend sounds caring. The first test deposit works and the balance grows, but larger withdrawals fail and support asks for extra fees. By then the money is trapped.
        </p>
        <p>
          Protection comes from boundaries. Separate relationships from finance. Never invest based on a private conversation, even if it feels real. Decline remote access tools and screen sharing. If someone pressures you to act quickly, step away and talk to a trusted friend offline. Isolation is the scammer’s favorite condition.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="custody">
        <h3>Why self custody and cold storage change the game</h3>
        <p>
          If you keep coins on a centralized platform, you accept platform risk. If you keep your recovery phrase in a photo or a note app, you accept device risk. The antidote is self custody with keys that never touch the internet. This is called cold storage and it turns most online attacks into noise. A hardware wallet signs transactions inside the device and reveals the address on its own screen so you can verify that you are sending where you intend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start with our deep guide to wallets and cold storage: <a class="orange-link" href="blog-bitcoin-wallets-cold-storage.html">Understanding Bitcoin Wallets and Why Cold Storage Matters</a>. Once you set up the device and practice with small amounts, confidence grows. Many long term holders keep only a small balance in a hot wallet for daily use and maintain their savings offline. This mirrors how you treat cash in a pocket versus assets in a safe.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you need to acquire Bitcoin or move funds, use reputable venues and avoid random links. Our <a class="orange-link" href="index.html#buy">Buy Bitcoin</a> section lists major exchanges so you can start on the right foot and then withdraw to your own wallet. Remember the rule that protects more people than any other. Not your keys, not your coins.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="checklist">
        <h3>A short security checklist</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Never share your recovery phrase with anyone. No exceptions.</li>
          <li>Type website addresses manually and bookmark the real ones.</li>
          <li>Use a hardware wallet for savings and verify addresses on device.</li>
          <li>Enable multifactor authentication with an authenticator app.</li>
          <li>Keep devices updated and remove unused browser extensions.</li>
          <li>Practice with small amounts before moving meaningful sums.</li>
          <li>Be suspicious of urgency, guaranteed returns, or private tips.</li>
          <li>Talk to a trusted friend before making big moves.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="report">
        <h3>If you made a mistake, do this fast</h3>
        <p>
          If you entered credentials on a fake site, change your password on the real site immediately and revoke any active sessions. If you approved a malicious connection in a wallet, revoke permissions using the wallet settings. If funds were sent, there is no reversal, but you can still help others by reporting the address to the platform you used and posting a warning in relevant communities. Most of all, pause before any further action. Scammers often follow with a recovery scam that asks for another payment to unlock funds. Do not engage.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="conclusion">
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          The design of Bitcoin favors careful people. With a few clear habits you can eliminate almost every common attack. Control your keys, ignore pressure, and verify before you sign or send. Use tools to think clearly about price and plans rather than chasing shortcuts. When in doubt, move slower. Time is your ally in security and in investing.
