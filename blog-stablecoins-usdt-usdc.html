      <section id="what" style="margin-top:18px">
        <h3>What is a stablecoin</h3>
        <p>
          A stablecoin is a digital token designed to track the price of a reference asset, most commonly the United States dollar.
          On public blockchains you can hold, send, and receive these tokens in minutes without traditional bank rails. The idea is simple:
          you get the speed and accessibility of crypto payments with the familiarity of a dollar reference. Two of the largest dollar stablecoins
          are <strong>USDT</strong> issued by Tether and <strong>USDC</strong> issued by Circle. They both aim to keep the price
          near one dollar through reserves and redemption mechanisms, yet they differ in governance, disclosures, and policies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stablecoins are not bank deposits. They are crypto tokens backed by reserves and rules set by their issuers.
          They are convenient and powerful, but they introduce counterparty and policy risk that pure Bitcoin does not.
          Think of them as a tool in the wider crypto economy rather than a replacement for long-term savings in scarce assets.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="how-peg">
        <h3>How the dollar peg is maintained</h3>
        <p>
          Most centralized dollar stablecoins maintain their peg with a combination of reserves and redemption. An authorized user can
          redeem one token for approximately one dollar, or mint new tokens by wiring dollars to the issuer. Market makers and arbitrageurs
          use this mechanism to keep the market price close to one. If the token trades below one, they can buy it on exchanges and redeem
          for dollars. If it trades above one, they can mint and sell. Over time this creates a self-correcting band around one dollar.
        </p>
        <p>
          The credibility of the peg depends on the reserves and the issuer’s ability to honor redemptions. Reserves can include cash,
          short-term U.S. treasuries, bank deposits, and in some cases other assets. Transparency reports and attestations help users
          evaluate the backing, but you must remember that you are trusting a company to manage assets and keep operations stable.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="usdt-usdc">
        <h3>USDT vs USDC at a glance</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>USDT (Tether):</strong> The longest-running and largest by market cap. It exists on many blockchains, is widely available
          on exchanges worldwide, and is popular in emerging markets. Tether publishes reserve breakdowns and attestations; critics often ask
          for more frequent and granular audits. Tether can freeze tokens at the contract level under certain conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>USDC (Circle):</strong> Designed with a strong emphasis on regulatory compliance and transparency. USDC is widely used
          in the United States and by compliant platforms. Circle releases frequent reserve updates and works closely with regulated partners.
          USDC can also freeze tokens in response to sanctions or legal orders. During stress events in traditional finance, USDC has temporarily
          deviated from one dollar but returned to the peg as market confidence recovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          For everyday users the practical difference is often about where you live, which exchanges you use, and your tolerance for jurisdictional risk.
          Both tokens are centralized and both can enforce blacklists. If censorship resistance is your priority, read our guide
          <a class="orange-link" href="blog-bitcoin-wallets-cold-storage.html">Understanding Bitcoin Wallets and Why Cold Storage Matters</a>
          and consider holding long-term savings in BTC self-custody instead.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="why-matters">
        <h3>Why stablecoins matter for adoption</h3>
        <p>
          Stablecoins solve a real usability problem. Crypto markets are volatile and many newcomers just want a digital dollar
          that settles quickly and works across borders. With stablecoins, exchanges can offer dollar pairs without banking friction,
          users can move value between platforms within minutes, and merchants can price goods in familiar units while experimenting
          with blockchain payments.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, stablecoins have become the <em>bridge asset</em> for on-ramps, off-ramps, and market infrastructure.
          They reduce currency conversion overhead, simplify accounting for businesses, and let people in high-inflation countries
          hold a dollar proxy when they cannot access real bank dollars.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="global-trade">
        <h3>Global trade and remittances</h3>
        <p>
          When a business in Argentina needs to pay a supplier in Turkey, the traditional route can involve multiple correspondent banks,
          compliance delays, and fees at every hop. With stablecoins, settlement can be near-instant and traceable on-chain with lower costs.
          In remittances, a worker can send value directly to family abroad without the long lines and high fees of legacy services.
        </p>
        <p>
          These patterns mirror the real-world stories in our feature
          <a class="orange-link" href="blog-bitcoin-developing-economies.html">Bitcoin in Developing Economies: A Lifeline Against Inflation</a>.
          While that article focuses on Bitcoin as a savings technology, stablecoins often play the role of day-to-day spending
          and invoicing. Many small businesses invoice in USDT or USDC to avoid local currency swings, then convert to BTC for long-term savings.

      <section id="defi-liquidity">
        <h3>DeFi, liquidity, and market plumbing</h3>
        <p>
          Stablecoins are the grease of crypto markets. Traders park capital in a dollar proxy between positions. Market makers quote prices
          in USDT or USDC pairs because dollars are the unit of account for most participants. In decentralized finance, stablecoins are used
          as collateral, for yield strategies, and as base liquidity for exchanges and lending markets. Whether you are bullish or cautious,
          stablecoins remain central to the flow of funds.
        </p>
        <p>
          This liquidity role has feedback effects. The more stable and liquid the dollar tokens, the more efficient the crypto markets become.
          That efficiency then attracts more users who appreciate fast settlement and clear pricing, further reinforcing adoption.

      <section id="risks">
        <h3>Risks you must understand</h3>
        <p>
          Stablecoins are powerful tools, but they are not risk-free. Here are the key categories you should know:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Counterparty risk:</strong> You rely on an issuer to hold reserves and honor redemptions. If the issuer fails, you bear loss.</li>
          <li><strong>Reserve quality and transparency:</strong> The composition of reserves matters. Short-term treasuries and cash are safer than risky assets. Read attestations carefully.</li>
          <li><strong>Depeg events:</strong> In times of market stress, a stablecoin can trade below one dollar temporarily. Arbitrage can restore the peg, but there is no guarantee.</li>
          <li><strong>Blacklisting and censorship:</strong> Centralized stablecoins can freeze specific addresses to comply with sanctions or legal orders. This is a policy risk for users requiring censorship resistance.</li>
          <li><strong>Banking and regulatory exposure:</strong> Reserves often sit in banks or money market instruments. Banking disruptions, regulatory actions, or jurisdictional changes can impact convertibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Smart contract and bridge risk:</strong> If you use stablecoins via bridges or complex DeFi contracts, bugs and exploits introduce additional attack surface.</li>
          <li><strong>Exchange risk:</strong> Holding stablecoins on a centralized exchange adds platform risk on top of issuer risk. Prefer self-custody when practical.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If your goal is long-term savings with minimal counterparty risk, review
          <a class="orange-link" href="blog-psychology-of-hodling.html">The Psychology of HODLing: Why Bitcoiners Never Sell</a>

      <section id="ops">
        <h3>Using stablecoins safely: practical steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Choose the right token for your region and platform.</strong> Liquidity and on-ramps differ across countries. Check fees and compliance requirements.</li>
          <li><strong>Prefer self-custody when feasible.</strong> Use a wallet you control. For meaningful balances, pair a desktop wallet with a hardware wallet.</li>
          <li><strong>Verify contract addresses.</strong> Phishing sites and fake tokens are common. Bookmark official docs, never paste seeds into web forms, and verify in-wallet.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep spending and savings separate.</strong> Use stablecoins for payments and working capital; move long-term savings into BTC cold storage.</li>
          <li><strong>Have an exit plan.</strong> If you receive stablecoins but want BTC exposure, use the <a class="orange-link" href="index.html#converter">Converter</a> to estimate amounts and allocate with a DCA plan.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid overengineering.</strong> Complex yield strategies can add smart contract risk. If you do not understand a product, skip it.</li>

      <section id="btc-bridge">
        <h3>Stablecoins as a bridge to Bitcoin</h3>
        <p>
          Many users meet crypto through stablecoins because they are familiar and easy to explain to a boss or a client. Over time those users
          discover the properties that make Bitcoin unique: digital scarcity, neutrality, and deep security backed by proof of work.
          Stablecoins serve commerce, while Bitcoin serves savings. The two are complementary.
        </p>

      <section id="conclusion">
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Stablecoins represent a practical stepping stone to the wider crypto economy. They carry the convenience of the dollar and the reach
          of public blockchains, making cross-border commerce faster and more inclusive. At the same time, they introduce centralized risks
          that users must manage with clear habits, careful custody, and a sober understanding of the peg mechanism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use stablecoins for operations and payments where they shine. Use Bitcoin for long-term savings where credibility and self-custody matter most.
          With the right mix, you can navigate global trade today while preparing for a future built on open monetary networks.
